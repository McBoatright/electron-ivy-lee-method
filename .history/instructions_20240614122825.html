    <h3>Welcome to The Ivy Lee Method!</h3>
    <p>This is a powerful technique to stay productive.
        It works great on its own or with other productivity methods.
         Here's how it works:

    </p>


    <p> At the end of each workday, add six or fewer tasks. 
        Prioritize them in order of importance. 
        When you start your day, work on the first task until it's done. 
        Then move on to the next task. Approach each task one at a time. 
        At the end of the day, leave the unfinished tasks for the next day. 
        You can prioritize the remaining tasks in a different order if needed.
         Repeat this process every workday. You can use the notes throughout the day. Enjoy!
