    <h3>Welcome to The Ivy Lee Method!</h3>
    <p>This is a powerful technicue to stay productive.
        It works great on its own or with other productivity methods.
        Here's how it works:</p>


    <p> At the end of each work day, add six or less tasks.
        Prioritize them in order of importance.
        When you start your day, work on the first task until it's done.
        Then move on to the next task. Aproach each task one at a time.
        At the end of the day, leave the unfished tasks for the next day.You can priorize the remaining tasks or add new ones.
